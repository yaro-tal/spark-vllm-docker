# Disk-Backed KV Offload Tier Fix

**Last updated:** `2026-09-02`

Makes vLLM's `OffloadingConnector` + `TieringOffloadingSpec` with a filesystem
secondary tier actually usable. Two bugs, shipped as one mod because **neither
fix is useful without the other**:

1. **`01-eagle-store-filter`** — with an EAGLE/MTP draft group, the tier returns
   **zero hits, ever**. Nothing is ever promoted, so nothing else matters.
2. **`02-multinode-promoted-row-resync`** — once hits do happen, **tensor
   parallelism across more than one node silently returns wrong KV**.

Apply only #1 and a two-node cluster gets a working cache that corrupts. Apply
only #2 and there is nothing to correct, because the cache never hits.

Verified against vLLM `e2666d9a65f41fc376607531453cbd57c4c71016` on
DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 across two DGX Sparks (TP=2, one GPU per node) with an
`fs` secondary tier.

---

## 1. EAGLE/MTP groups can never certify a hit

The store path drops sliding-window chunks that no lookup could reach, keeping
only the trailing `tail` chunks of each full-attention alignment segment:

```python
if pos_in_segment < alignment_chunk_count - tail:
    continue
```

But `_sliding_window_lookup` finds `tail` chunks and an **unverified EAGLE group
then pops one** (`num_hit_chunks -= 1`). It therefore needs `tail + 1`
*consecutive* chunks to certify anything, and the store filter has already
guaranteed it can never see them.

Because `_lookup()` **ANDs the per-group results**, the eagle group's permanent
zero vetoes every other group as well. The whole tier reports a 0% hit rate
while happily writing hundreds of GB. Observed here as 502 GB stored and
0 bytes ever read back.

The fix keeps the segment-head chunk for eagle groups, so the retained set is
`{0} ∪ {acc-tail .. acc-1}` — a run of exactly `tail + 1` consecutive chunks
across the segment boundary, which is what the reader demands. The pop lands on
a chunk at `0 (mod acc)`, so the resulting length stays a multiple of the
full-attention chunk size, i.e. inside the admissible set.

Cost depends on `blocks_per_chunk`: at 8 it is a swap (2-in-4 kept either way);
at 1 it is a ~50% increase in that group's stores. Correctness is
`blocks_per_chunk`-independent.

## 2. Multi-node TP silently serves wrong KV

`SharedOffloadRegion` is a **per-node `/dev/shm` mmap**. On one node the
scheduler-side region (`rank=None`) and every worker region (`rank=r`) are the
*same file* — `rank` only selects a slot *within* a row — so a promotion the
tier manager performs is visible to every worker for free. That assumption is
undocumented, and false as soon as TP spans nodes: each node has its own mmap,
and only the rank co-located with the manager runs a secondary tier at all.

- **GPU→CPU stores stay symmetric** — every rank writes its own region.
- **disk→CPU promotions land only on the manager's rank.**
- the following **CPU→GPU load reads each rank's *own* region**.

Every other rank feeds its GPU whatever stale bytes occupied that row. Nothing
raises, nothing warns, no checksum fails.

Hashing the same row index in both nodes' mmaps, before the fix:

| rows | identical across ranks |
|---|---|
| written by GPU→CPU stores | **112 / 112** |
| written by disk→CPU promotion | **0 / 112** |

Over a longer run the correspondence was exact: every divergent row was a
promoted row, and every promoted row was divergent. After the fix, **112 / 112**.

The symptom depends only on what was in the stale row, which is why it presents
as several unrelated bugs:

| the other rank's row held | output |
|---|---|
| zeros (fresh mmap after restart) | coherent, first checkpoint correct, later ones confabulated |
| another request's KV (recycled row) | multilingual token soup, immediate EOS, **other sessions' content bleeding into the response** |

Hits served entirely from the CPU tier are always correct, because no promotion
is involved and the regions already agree — which is what makes this so hard to
catch. It only misbehaves once a prefix has been evicted to disk and comes back.

### The fix

The tier manager records which rows a **completed** promotion filled;
`build_connector_meta()` drains them into
`OffloadingConnectorMetadata.promoted_rows`; every rank re-syncs those rows from
the manager's rank over the existing TP group **before any load is submitted**.

`build_connector_meta()` runs `on_schedule_end()` → completed-job processing
first, so a promotion that lands in a step ships its row ids in that same step's
metadata. Every rank receives an identical list, so all ranks issue the same
collectives in the same order — which is what keeps the broadcast from
deadlocking. Rows are sorted and coalesced into contiguous runs under a 64 MiB
cap, so a large promotion costs a handful of collectives rather than hundreds.

**Read once, transfer over the link.** Letting every rank read the tier itself
would be strictly worse: the tier would have to be shared, so a second reader
pulls the same bytes over the same link *anyway* and hits the backing disk
twice. On a Spark pair the disk is the slow part (0.65–1.4 GB/s, worse under
concurrency) and the ConnectX link is not (3.45 GB/s single-stream).

**Consequence worth having: the secondary tier no longer needs to be shared.**
Only the manager's rank reads it, so it can be node-local — no NFS, no shared
filesystem, no mount guard on the worker node.

### Safety gate

Re-syncing one rank's rows onto another is only correct if the KV cache is
**replicated** across TP ranks. MLA stores a single compressed latent per token
and is replicated by construction. A head-sharded cache (GQA/MHA) or per-rank
recurrent state genuinely differs per rank, and copying over it would corrupt it
exactly as thoroughly as the bug being fixed.

So the mod does nothing unless every KV group is known-replicated, and it says
which way it decided:

```
KV offload: kv_replicated_across_tp=True (all KV groups are MLA:
  MLAAttentionSpec, SlidingWindowMLASpec); promoted rows will be re-synced
KV offload: re-synced 112 promoted rows in 17 collectives (965214208 bytes)
KV offload: promoted-row re-sync verified on 8 rows across 2 ranks
```

The last line is a one-shot check run immediately after a broadcast, on the rows
just sent, where equality holds by construction — it catches a wrong row stride
or a rank writing into the wrong region, neither of which has any symptom other
than bad output.

**On single-node deployments patch #2 is a no-op**, so it is safe to leave
applied.

## Usage

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh --apply-mod mods/fix-kv-offload-disk-tier exec vllm serve <model> \
  --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
  --kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"OffloadingConnector","kv_role":"kv_both",
    "kv_connector_extra_config":{
      "spec_name":"TieringOffloadingSpec",
      "cpu_bytes_to_use":4294967296,
      "blocks_per_chunk":8,
      "eviction_policy":"lru",
      "secondary_tiers":[{"type":"fs","root_dir":"/root/.cache/vllm-kv-offload",
                          "n_read_threads":16,"n_write_threads":4}]}}'
```

Mount the tier following the repo's usual cache convention, on the **head node
only**:

```
-v $HOME/.cache/vllm-kv-offload:/root/.cache/vllm-kv-offload
```

**Set `PYTHONHASHSEED` to the same fixed value everywhere.** Without it
`NONE_HASH` is seeded from `os.urandom(32)` per process, so identical tokens
hash differently after every restart and nothing on disk is ever found again.
vLLM already warns about this; the tier makes it expensive. Verify it actually
reaches the engine process rather than just the container — and note that
`/proc/<pid>/environ` is unreliable for `VLLM::EngineCore`, which calls
`setproctitle` and clobbers that region.

`blocks_per_chunk` is the disk-size lever: ~3.6 GB per 131k-token prompt at 8,
~13.3 GB at 1. Both ranks must carry the same value.

### Environment variables

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_KV_REPLICATED` | unset | force the replication gate `0`/`1`, for cache types the check does not recognise |
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_MIRROR_STRICT` | `1` | `0` downgrades the post-broadcast check from raise to warn |
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_MIRROR_MAX_BYTES` | `67108864` | bytes per collective |
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_MIRROR_LOG_EVERY` | `100` | log the first re-sync then every Nth; `0` disables the periodic line |

## Verifying on your own cluster

Output alone is a weak signal — a corrupt load can still produce fluent text.
Check the mechanism: hash the same row index in both nodes' mmaps after a load
served from disk.

```bash
docker exec <container> python3 -c "
import hashlib, os
p = [f for f in os.listdir('/dev/shm') if f.startswith('vllm_offload_')][0]
p = '/dev/shm/' + p
n = 498                                   # your num_blocks
stride = os.path.getsize(p) // n
f = open(p, 'rb')
for r in (0, 1, 2, 50, 100):
    f.seek(r * stride)
    print(r, hashlib.sha256(f.read(stride)).hexdigest()[:16])
"
```

Digests must match across nodes for any row a promotion filled. Before patch #2
they never do; after it, they always do.

Make sure the load really came from disk — a CPU-tier hit proves nothing, and
`reset_prefix_cache` does **not** drain the CPU tier at `blocks_per_chunk > 1`.
Force eviction with unrelated filler prompts first.

## Upstream

Bug #2 is a concrete cause for the failure class in vLLM RFC #54363 — "content
that is the right length and the wrong bytes … consumed as attention KV,
producing wrong logits with no error signal anywhere". If re-syncing is
considered out of scope upstream, the minimal alternative is for
`TieringOffloadingSpec` to **refuse to start** when the tier manager's region is
not shared by every rank, rather than silently serving wrong KV.


---

## Patch 03 — matching decoupled from staging (2026-09-08)

**Patches 01 and 02 make the disk tier *correct*. They do not make it *useful*
on a prefix larger than your primary tier. This one does.**

If you applied this mod before 03 existed and saw the tier do nothing — no
error, no warning, just persistent zero hits — this is why.

### The bug

`TieringOffloadingManager.lookup` ends:

```python
return LookupResult.MISS if not promoted else LookupResult.RETRY
```

The matching walk promoted **one primary-tier row per queried key**, purely to
confirm the key was there. Once the tier filled, every subsequent key — *including
keys sitting on disk* — returned `MISS`, indistinguishable from "never stored".
The cross-group AND (`if num_hit_chunks == 0: return 0`) then discarded the whole
external hit.

Self-reinforcing: the walk consumed the rows `prepare_store` needed, so the tier
stopped being **written** too, and never recovered on its own.

**This will hit most users of this image.** The tier is sized from host RAM and
these are 128 GB boxes; with a large model resident, `cpu_bytes_to_use` of a few
GiB buys only a few hundred rows. A long agent conversation queries far more keys
than that in a single match. On our 4 GiB / 498-row tier, a 242k-token prefix
queried **12,434** keys.

### The 30-second diagnosis

Sum the per-group RETRY counts on a vetoed lookup. **If the sum pins at exactly
your tier's row count, you are hitting this and your data is on disk.** Confirm
the row count independently from metric granularity: `kv_offload_cpu_cache_usage_perc`
only ever takes values `k/rows` (ours reported `0.08032128514056225` = `40/498`).

Do not read a high miss count as disk absence without checking this first. That
misreading cost us two weeks.

### The fix

Match with `promote=False`, then stage the confirmed hit in **waves** so a hit
larger than the tier can still be served. Three new stdlib-only modules
(`wave_slicer.py`, `parking_gate.py`, `parking_sm.py`), each with host-runnable
tests, plus the driver in `scheduler.py` and the `promote` flag in `manager.py`.

### Measured on a live 2-node TP=2 DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 cluster

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| summed RETRY per probe | 498 | **0** |
| `exit=ZERO` | 14 | **0** |
| `cannot store chunks` | 2 | **0** |
| cold 294,186-token prompt | `ext=0` | **`ext=290,816`** (98.9%) |

Also verified since:

- **Multi-wave really runs.** 23 loads at `num_waves=2`/`3`. Slicing exact:
  `ext=305152 wave_sizes=[64, 64, 26]` is 64+64+21 = 149 g0 chunks =
  305152/2048, sliding-window groups riding the last wave. Blocks close end to
  end: 512+512+190 = 1214 = 149x8 + 22.
- **Both ranks.** Same job ids and `src_blocks` on each; rank 1 emits the
  matching `cpu_to_gpu` transfers. The `src_offset`/`dst_offset` asserts survive
  wave boundaries.
- **Streaming beats tier size.** A **1 GiB (124-row)** tier served a cold
  **348,000-token** prompt at `ext=346112` — **99.5%**. That prefix needs ~170
  rows to stage, so it is monolithically impossible; only waves can do it.
- **Output is not degraded.** Next-token distribution from tier-served KV is
  *within the engine's own noise floor*, and equal to vLLM's own GPU prefix
  cache (2.95 vs 2.93, floor 3.20). Tooling: `tools/kv-quality-ab.py` in our
  repo.
- **Parking works** (16 slot events, all released, no hang) but is **OFF by
  default** — `VLLM_OFFLOAD_PARK=1` to enable. Treat it as the least-exercised
  part of this patch.

### Tuning

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_STREAM_WAVE_CHUNKS` | 64 | chunks per wave. **0 makes this patch fully inert** — the fastest revert, verified by a dark baseline. |
| `VLLM_OFFLOAD_PARK` | 0 | admission gate. Only reachable when a request's demand exceeds half the tier. |

A wave holds `WAVE_CHUNKS x tokens_per_chunk` tokens. At 256 and a 2048-token
chunk that is 524,288 — larger than most workloads, so it never splits. If you
want waves to actually engage, size it against your prefixes.

### Honest scope

- Ships ~70 lines of **env-gated diagnostics** (`KVPROBE`/`KVCOV`/`KVPROV` and a
  shadow load-solver), all inert unless their env var is set. They are the
  instruments that found this; removing them by hand would ship code we have not
  run.
- **`cannot store chunks` is a separate, pre-existing failure, and you should
  expect to meet it.** `prepare_store` cannot allocate rows, and that path
  neither advances the cursor nor backs off nor throttles its log — so the
  request retries the identical oversized batch on *every* scheduler step.
  Measured on our workload (~250-350k-token prompts):

  | `cpu_bytes_to_use` | rows | `cannot store chunks` |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 GiB | 124 | **8,870** lines from 40 requests, worst one 1,847x, ~218/min |
  | 2 GiB | 249 | **0** |

  So: **raise `cpu_bytes_to_use` until it stops.** The right value scales with
  your prompt length, not with this table — a store batch is
  `num_offloadable_tokens / tokens_per_chunk` summed over groups, and the
  sliding-window groups dominate it (a 348k prompt wants ~17,800 chunk-rows in
  total, of which 91% are g3/g4 at 32- and 64-token chunks).

  Note this is **not** what `VLLM_OFFLOAD_STREAM_WAVE_CHUNKS` controls — wave
  size governs the *load* path and is not referenced in the store path at all.
  Halving it frees ~32 rows against a deficit in the hundreds.

  Not introduced by 03 — but 03 makes small tiers useful enough that you may
  now run one small enough to hit this.

## Patch 04 — wave readiness evaluated at load (2026-09-21)

**Fixes an engine crash in 03's wave driver that we hit after 20.6 h under
concurrent load.**

### The bug

```
File ".../offloading/scheduler.py", in build_connector_meta
    src_spec = self.manager.prepare_load(w.keys, req_status.req_context)
File ".../kv_offload/tiering/manager.py", in prepare_load
    return self.primary_tier.prepare_load(keys, req_context)
File ".../kv_offload/cpu/manager.py", in prepare_load
    assert block is not None, f"Block {key!r} not found in cache"
AssertionError: Block b'...' not found in cache
```

`EngineCore` dies and every in-flight request gets `EngineDeadError`. Seen once,
after 20.6 h of production traffic on our own two-DGX-Spark cluster
(DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731, TP=2, one GPU per node, `fs` tier), running 01–03 with
`VLLM_OFFLOAD_STREAM_WAVE_CHUNKS=64`. Our image also carries unrelated local
patches outside the offload path.

03's driver *remembers* readiness. It records a wave's keys in `wave_ready_keys`
as they become resident in the primary tier (their promotion completed, they
were already resident, or another request promoted them) and ships the wave
once every key has been seen. But a resident row is only pinned by
`prepare_load()` (ref_cnt 0 → 1). Until then it is evictable, so a key that
became ready while the rest of its wave was still promoting can be evicted by
any other request's `prepare_store`/`prepare_write` before the wave's last key
lands. The driver then loads a key that is gone. As far as we can see, this is
the only way the wave path can reach that assert; the eviction of the failing key
itself was not logged.

### The fix

Evaluate readiness, never remember it. `TieringOffloadingManager.wave_lookup()`
asks the primary tier about the whole wave in the same pass as the
`prepare_load()` that pins it:

| `wave_lookup` | driver |
|---|---|
| `HIT` (every key resident and readable) | `prepare_load`, ship the wave |
| `HIT_PENDING` (a write is still in flight: a promotion, or another request's store) | wait |
| `MISS` (evicted, failed promotion, `reset_cache` wipe) | re-stage the wave; `promote_for_staging` re-reads only the absent keys |

`wave_ready_keys`, `pop_ready_keys` and `WaveSpec.promoted` are removed.

Stuck waves are now visible. Every step a wave makes no progress, staging
refused or re-staged after a `MISS`, is counted in
`vllm:kv_offload_wave_retry_total{reason="promote_refused"|"miss"}`. The log warns
at `VLLM_OFFLOAD_STREAM_WAVE_MAX_RETRIES` (default 50) and at each doubling.
Before, only refusals incremented the retry count, and it warned once, at the
ceiling.

### Verified

- `test-wave-lookup.py` replays the eviction on vLLM's real
  `CPUOffloadingManager`: `HIT_PENDING` while the wave promotes, `MISS` after
  another request's store evicts a ready key (where `prepare_load` raises the
  exact assertion above), `HIT` after re-staging. It also checks that the counter
  is exported. No GPU needed; from `mods/fix-kv-offload-disk-tier`:
  `docker run --rm --entrypoint python3 -v "$PWD/test-wave-lookup.py:/t.py:ro" <image> /t.py`
- 01–04 apply with `git apply` on vLLM `e2666d9a65f41fc376607531453cbd57c4c71016`,
  all touched files compile, and a second `run.sh` skips.
- vLLM's `tests/v1/kv_connector/unit/offloading_connector` and
  `tests/v1/kv_offload`: the same pass/fail set with and without 04 (403
  passed). We ran them in a container without a GPU, so the GPU-dependent tests
  could not run either way.
- Live, on that cluster: after a full restart, a 175,022-token prompt restored from
  disk in 3.2 s through the new path, with no errors. The prefill that first stored
  it took 139.5 s.
  The original crash took 20.6 h to appear, so hours without a recurrence are
  weak evidence; the replay is the proof of mechanism.

### Honest scope

- **Retries are still unbounded.** A key the secondary tier has lost re-reads
  every step while its request holds the GPU blocks allocated up front. The
  abort-and-recompute fallback (03's OPEN A) is still not implemented; 04 makes
  that case visible (`reason="miss"` climbing on one wave), not bounded.
- Unrelated to 04, found while running the tests: with 03 applied, 23 tests in
  vLLM's `tests/v1/kv_connector/unit/offloading_connector/test_scheduler.py` fail with
  `TypeError: _make_scheduler_with_lookup.<locals>.<lambda>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'promote'`,
  because the test's `lookup` mock does not accept 03's new `promote=` argument.
- vLLM #54914 reports the same assertion on stock vLLM without this mod. 04 fixes
  only the wave path and says nothing about that report's cause.
- Written with AI assistance (Claude) and verified on that cluster.

## Patch 05 — staged wave rows held until their load retires (2026-09-22)

**04 stopped the crash by re-staging a wave whose key went missing. It did not
stop the eviction, and on our cluster that turned the crash into a stall of
over 100 s.**

### The bug

`vllm:kv_offload_wave_retry_total{reason="miss"}` reached **207 in 15 h** of
production traffic, and two concurrent cold restores (136,963- and
163,907-token prompts) each hit the 50-step warning and sat **over 100 s**
before serving. Both completed — no aborts, no errors — but 04's own
measurement for a 175 K restore was 3.2 s.

A wave's rows land at `ref_cnt 0` when `complete_write()` finishes their
promotion, and only `prepare_load()` pins them, so in between they are
evictable. `prepare_store` protects only the keys of the store it is serving.
A store batch that is large relative to the tier fits only by evicting most of
what is evictable, and a just-landed wave is evictable, so the sweep takes it.
(A batch needing more rows than are *evictable* is refused outright — the
"cannot store chunks" case in 03's scope — and evicts nothing.) Two concurrent
restores evict each other the same way, and each re-stage re-reads the same
keys from disk.

### The fix

The tiering manager holds a wave's rows from staging until the wave's load
retires. Only a *wave's* rows are held:

- `promote_for_staging()` records the whole wave in `wave_expect`, and holds
  the wave's keys that are already resident and readable. Those are not part
  of its reservation (`prepare_write` reserves only keys the tier lacks), so
  losing one would send the whole wave back for another read.
- Whenever rows become readable — a promotion completing, or a GPU store
  completing — `_hold_for_waiting_waves()` takes one `prepare_load()` hold on
  each of them **for every request whose wave expects it**. Expectations are
  per request, so holds are too: a key a wave shares with another request's
  read or store is held for this wave as well, and each request releases only
  its own hold. The non-streaming path promotes a row for every key it merely
  *queries*; no wave expects those, so they are never held, and with
  `VLLM_OFFLOAD_STREAM_WAVE_CHUNKS=0` this patch is inert.

Every hold is released on exactly one of these:

- `complete_load()` — the wave's load retires (releases the keys it consumed,
  and drops them from `wave_expect`, so a finished wave expects nothing);
- `release_wave_pins()` — the driver releases before re-staging after a MISS,
  which also clears `wave_expect`, so a promotion landing afterwards takes no
  hold;
- `_maybe_finalize_request()` — the request finishes, before its state is
  dropped, so an aborted request cannot strand rows;
- `reset_cache()` — forgets them, since it drops every row and zeroes every
  refcount anyway.

### Why it cannot deadlock

A deadlock needs a cycle in the wait-for graph, and a cycle needs someone who
holds rows while waiting for rows. So the property to keep is: **a holder never
waits for a row.**

- Rows are only ever waited for at a reservation (`prepare_write()` /
  `prepare_store()`), which is all-or-nothing: a refused reservation acquires
  nothing and its caller retries on a later step. For a wave, that reservation
  is in `promote_for_staging()`.
- Every path back to `promote_for_staging()` releases first (MISS; a new wave
  starts only after the previous one's `complete_load()`), so a wave that waits
  for rows holds none. Preemption needs no case: a request holding staged rows
  is waiting on its load, and only running requests are preempted.
- A wave that holds rows is waiting only on I/O — its own promotion, or
  another request's read or store (`HIT_PENDING`) — and in-flight I/O already
  owns its rows and completes without acquiring any. Holds taken on another
  request's behalf when rows land never wait either: those rows are already
  resident.

So every wait-for edge starts at something holding nothing, and no cycle can
form. The driver also releases on a *refused* re-stage; by the argument above a
wave there holds nothing already, so that call is a guard that makes
hold-and-wait unrepresentable rather than merely unreachable.

This matters at realistic sizes: a full wave is 64 full-attention chunks (the
last wave of a request is the remainder, and also carries the sliding-window
rows), and requests waiting on a restore are bounded by GPU blocks rather than
`max_num_seqs`, so held waves can exceed a 573-row tier — twelve full waves
already would.

### Also fixed: a zero-key promotion job

A wave whose keys are *all* already resident reserves nothing, yet
`promote_for_staging()` still queued an entry and `_flush_pending_promotions()`
submitted it with no keys. On the `fs` tier, `DualQueueThreadPool.enqueue_load()`
increments `_inflight_jobs` and enqueues nothing, so the job never retires:
`has_pending_work()` stays true forever and `wait_idle()` — hence
`drain_jobs()` and `reset_cache()` — never returns. It is reachable whenever a
wave's keys are warm. Zero-key entries are no longer submitted. (The wave itself
still progresses: `wave_lookup()` answers HIT and it loads.)

### Verified

- `test-wave-lookup.py` (extended; no GPU needed) drives the real code paths
  next to the 04 checks: a completed promotion is held and a competing store
  cannot evict it; `promote_for_staging()` holds a wave's resident keys and
  expects the whole wave; a key two waves share is held for both, whether it
  lands from one request's read or from another request's store, and stays
  held for the waiting wave after the reader is done with it; the hold is
  released by the load, by a re-stage, and
  at finalize through `on_request_finished()`; a promotion no
  wave staged is not held; a zero-key entry is not submitted; and a landed,
  released or finished wave leaves nothing in `wave_expect`. Holding only for
  the request that did the read, dropping the store-path hold, the resident
  hold, the finalize release, the expectation cleanup or the zero-key skip
  each make it fail.

  `e2666d9a65f41fc376607531453cbd57c4c71016`, all touched files compile, and a
  second `run.sh` skips.
- vLLM's `tests/v1/kv_connector/unit/offloading_connector` and
  `tests/v1/kv_offload`: same pass/fail set with and without 05 (403 passed;
  GPU-dependent tests cannot run in our container either way).
- Live on the same two-DGX-Spark TP=2 DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 cluster: zero
  `wave_retry` samples of either reason since deploying, across concurrent cold
  restores; a needle probe buried 25 % into a 101 K-token prompt restored
  through the tier and came back exact.

### Honest scope

- **The trade.** A store can no longer evict a held row, so
  `cannot store chunks` may appear more often on a tight tier. That is the right
  way round — a store retries on its own, a stalled restore is user-visible.
  Our tier is 4.08 GiB = 573 rows at `blocks_per_chunk=4`; rows scale with your
  configuration, so read yours from `kv_offload_cpu_cache_usage_perc`'s
  granularity (it only takes values `k/rows`).
- **Starvation is not ruled out.** A wave can lose a key it did not hold,
  re-read it, and lose it again; each cycle releases its holds, so others make
  progress, but that one request can be starved. That is 03's OPEN A, and
  `reason="miss"` climbing on one wave is its signature.
- **Not fixed here, found while auditing:** a wave-streaming request aborted
  while no load is in flight (still promoting, refused or re-staging) gets
  `delay_free_blocks`, but the worker only reports `finished_recving` when a
  load job retires, so its GPU blocks are never freed. That is in the
  interaction with the core scheduler, not in this patch.
- Written with AI assistance (Claude) and verified on that cluster.
